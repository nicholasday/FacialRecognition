# FacialRecognition

We have installed OpenCV Java into our project, created our FaceRecognitionUIController which uses the webcam on the computer to detect a face. Button and Label classes for augmented reality on the webcam have been created. We made these classes because we wanted to overlay these on the screen, unlike JavaFXâ€™s buttons and labels. We have decided to implement a Trainer class (not on our project design) to encapsulate the methods required to create the eigenvectors for the initial face database. Currently, only the getAverageFace method is implemented in that class, but we believe there may be an error with OpenCV Mat overflows. For our final deliverable, we need to implement the connection to the online web service that we wrote to actually log the signins. We need to finish the Trainer class and use our algorithm to to recognize faces from the database generated in the Trainer class. We have a plan on how to write the algorithm (we took a lot of time to understand the algorithm), but are having issues using OpenCV in Java, which is much harder to setup and use compared to previous experiences with NumPy and OpenCV in Python.
